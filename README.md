This is a plugin that contains several features that I think would improve the classic survival experience. This plugin is only functional in Spigot 1.20.1.

**Features:**
- Suspicious sand can now generate on the desert biome's surface. Upon brushing, it can reveal either junk or rarely treasure such as diamonds or emeralds
- Large patches of suspicious sand can now generate on the desert biome's surface that when brushed reveal bones. These patches reveal that somewhere under them lies a fossil. 
- Suspicious sand and gravel can now generate in rivers which can reveal gold upon being brushed
- Natural ore generation for iron, gold, diamonds and ancient debris have been reduced
- The mending enchantment has been changed. Upon picking up an experience orb, gear with mending will no longer automatically repair itself. Rather, it will reduce its repair cost at an anvil.
- Netherite gear can now be repaired at an anvil with diamonds
- Elder Guardians now have a 1/3 chance of dropping a Mending Book
- Crops now grow at roughly half their usual speed unless it is raining. However, with a Sniffer nearby they only grow roughly 20% slower than vanilla.
- Carrots and Potatoes will now only drop one of theirselves regardless if they are full grown or not.
- Wheat and Beetroot will now only drop one themselves and their respective seed if they are fully grown
- Bonemealing Wheat, Beetroot, Carrots and Potatoes no longer instantly grows them. However, if they are bonemealed when initially placed, they will always yield one extra drop when harvested at full growth.
- Fortune hoes are now the only tool that can cause crops to drop more of itself now.
- Added Suspicious Stew recipe for Pitcher Plant -> Grants Luck I for 5 minutes
- Animals will have a much longer breeding cooldown after being bred
- Animals will no longer breed if the area around them is too crowded
- Villagers will no longer grant huge discounts to players that have cured them. They can still grant small discounts from curing that will eventually spread to other villagers that they talk to. (This prevents trades that are far too cheap and also encourages the completion of raids)
- Honey Bottles now cure the Wither effect in addition to the Poison effect
- After a player mines Ancient Debris for the first time, piglins and piglin brutes will begin to naturally spawn in the overworld around them
- Phantoms will no longer naturally drop phantom membranes 
- After a player enters the end, phantoms that naturally spawn around them will be slightly bigger and can drop phantom membranes (to repair elytra with)
- After a player enters the end, the naturally spawning piglins around them will always spawn with a piece of netherite armor (that can't be dropped)
- Wandering Traders will now always sell either a Stopwatch (When held shows your current speed in km/h) or a Metal Detector (Detects any ores under you when held)
- The Drill Block can now be crafted using 7 Copper Blocks, 1 Redstone Dust and 1 Diamond Pickaxe. When placed and fed coal as fuel, it starts digging a 3x3 tunnel in the direction it is facing. However, it can not break certain blocks that are too 'hard' (Example: Obsidian, Bedrock, etc.).
- Minecarts can now be linked together using by Sneak + Right Clicking on them with chains. The first minecart clicked will pull the second one that was clicked.
- If a minecart travels over a powered rail with a copper block under it, its max speed increases by 3x. If it travels over a normal powered rail, its max speed goes back to normal. Minecarts tend to derail at turns or ramps if they are going too fast so make sure they are slowed down when approaching one.
- If a minecart travels over an unpowered rail with chiseled deepslate under it, it will stop much faster than usual. Furnace Minecarts also stop burning as well.
- Furnace minecarts can now travel much faster. They also automatically load chunks, so use a few of them to allow minecart trains to go through unloaded chunks.
- 4 Regular Rails can now be crafted with 7 Iron Nuggets and 1 Stick. This is a much more efficient craft compared to the vanilla craft.
- A Turtle Helmet can now be upgraded as a netherite upgrade into a Strider Helmet. The Strider Helmet grants 20 seconds of extra water breathing and 5 seconds of extra fire resistance.

This is a plugin that contains several features that I think would improve the classic survival experience. This plugin is only functional in Spigot 1.20.1.

**Features:**
- Suspicious sand can now generate on the desert biome's surface. Upon brushing, it can reveal either junk or rarely treasure such as diamonds or emeralds
- Large patches of suspicious sand can now generate on the desert biome's surface that when brushed reveal bones. These patches reveal that somewhere under them lies a fossil. 
- Suspicious sand and gravel can now generate in rivers which can reveal gold upon being brushed
- Natural ore generation for iron, gold, diamonds and ancient debris have been reduced
- The mending enchantment has been changed. Upon picking up an experience orb, gear with mending will no longer automatically repair itself. Rather, it will reduce its repair cost at an anvil.
- Netherite gear can now be repaired at an anvil with diamonds
- Elder Guardians now have a 1/3 chance of dropping a Mending Book
- Crops now grow at roughly half their usual speed. However, with a Sniffer nearby they only grow roughly 20% slower than vanilla.
- Carrots and Potatoes will now only drop one of theirselves regardless if they are full grown or not.
- Wheat and Beetroot will now only drop one themselves and their respective seed if they are fully grown
- Bonemealing Wheat, Beetroot, Carrots and Potatoes no longer instantly grows them. However, if they are bonemealed when initially placed, they will always yield one extra drop when harvested at full growth.
- Fortune hoes are now the only tool that can cause crops to drop more of itself now.
- Added Suspicious Stew recipe for Pitcher Plant -> Grants Luck I for 5 minutes
- Animals will have a much longer breeding cooldown after being bred
- Animals will no longer breed if the area around them is too crowded
- Villagers will no longer grant huge discounts to players that have cured them. They can still grant small discounts from curing that will eventually spread to other villagers that they talk to. (This prevents trades that are far too cheap and also encourages the completion of raids)
- Honey Bottles now cure the Wither effect in addition to the Poison effect
- After a player mines Ancient Debris for the first time, piglins and piglin brutes will begin to naturally spawn in the overworld around them
- Phantoms will no longer naturally drop phantom membranes 
- After a player enters the end, phantoms that naturally spawn around them will be slightly bigger and can drop phantom membranes (to repair elytra with)
- After a player enters the end, the naturally spawning piglins around them will always spawn with a piece of netherite armor (that can't be dropped)

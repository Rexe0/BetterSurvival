This is a plugin that contains several features that I think would improve the classic survival experience. This plugin is only functional in Spigot 1.20.1.

### Features
**Agriculture:**
- Crops now grow at roughly half their usual speed unless it is raining. However, with a Sniffer nearby they only grow roughly 20% slower than vanilla.
- Carrots and Potatoes will now only drop two of themselves when fully grown
- Wheat and Beetroot will now only drop one of themselves and two of their respective seeds when they are fully grown
- Bonemealing Wheat, Beetroot, Carrots and Potatoes no longer instantly grows them. However, if they are bonemealed when initially placed, they will always yield one extra drop and seed when harvested at full growth.
- Composting fish now grants fertilizer, a type of bonemeal which increases the growth rate of the crop depending on its tier
- Fortune hoes are now the only tool that can cause crops to drop more of itself now.
- Wheat Seeds, Beetroot Seeds, Carrots and Potatoes can now be automatically planted using a dispenser
- Added Suspicious Stew recipe for Pitcher Plant -> Grants Luck I for 5 minutes
- Added Cornucopia food item, made from 2 Golden Carrots, 2 Beetroots, 2 Baked potatoes and 1 Haybale. 
- On the 20th day of Spring there will be a bumper crop where all crops grow faster and have a much higher yield during the day
- Animals will have a much longer breeding cooldown after being bred
- Animals will no longer breed if the area around them is too crowded
- Honey Bottles now cure the Wither effect in addition to the Poison effect
- Every compostable item will now always increase the compost's level. The amount of compost generated is dependent on the item.
- Right clicking a filled water cauldron with a fire/campfire underneath it with soup/stew ingredients will place the ingredients within the cauldron
- If you place all the necessary ingredients for a soup within that cauldron, it will play a distinct sound, indicating that the soup has been cooked (Rabbit Stew requires both mushrooms instead of only one)
- Right clicking a cauldron full of soup with a bowl will grant you that soup in its bowl form, allowing it to be eaten. This can be done up to three times.
- Farmer Boots can be made using 4 leather and 2 copper ingots which prevent players from breaking crops when worn
- Added Cannabis which can be grown and cultivated to higher potencies if grown in a warm environment with high quality fertilizer
- Added the Smoke Pipe which can be used to extract the psychoactive effects of Cannabis, crafted using 2 sticks, 1 coal and 1 torch
- Added Coca Leaves which can be grown and cultivated to higher potencies if grown in a warm and humid environment with high quality fertilizer
- Cocaine can be extracted from 5 Coca Leaves using a crafting table. It can be directly used to grant stimulating effects
- Blocks of Cocaine can be created with 9 Cocaine to allow for compact storage
- Using Cocaine or Cannabis too much in a short time span will cause an overdose dealing large damage to the player

**Ores and Mining:**
- Large Coal deposits can now generate slightly under the surface in Badlands/Mesa biomes
- Large Iron deposits can now generate slightly under the ocean floor in cold oceans
- Large Copper deposits can now generate slightly under the surface in very mountainous biomes
- Sculk Catalysts in the Deep Dark can now passively spread sculk to nearby blocks
- Mining Sculk Shriekers now has a chance to yield 1 Echo Shard
- The Drill Block can now be crafted using 7 Copper Blocks, 1 Redstone Dust and 1 Diamond Pickaxe. When placed and fed coal as fuel, it starts digging a 3x3 tunnel in the direction it is facing. However, it can not break certain blocks that are too 'hard' (Example: Obsidian, Bedrock, etc.).

**Villagers:**
- Wandering Traders will now always sell either a Stopwatch (When held shows your current speed in km/h), Metal Detector (Detects any ores a few blocks under you when held), a Fish Codex (see Fishing section) or a drug plant (Cannabis or Coca Leaves if in the jungle)

**Minecarts:**
- Minecarts can now be linked together using by Sneak + Right Clicking on them with chains. The first minecart clicked will pull the second one that was clicked.
- If a minecart travels over a powered rail with a copper block under it, its max speed increases by 3x. If it travels over a normal powered rail, its max speed goes back to normal. Minecarts tend to derail at turns or ramps if they are going too fast so make sure they are slowed down when approaching one.
- If a minecart travels over an unpowered rail with chiseled deepslate under it, it will stop much faster than usual. Furnace Minecarts also stop burning as well.
- Furnace minecarts can now travel much faster. They also automatically load chunks, so use a few of them to allow minecart trains to go through unloaded chunks.
- Dispensers can now automatically power furnace minecarts in the direction they are facing when shooting out coal or charcoal
- 4 Regular Rails can now be crafted with 6 Iron Nuggets and 1 Stick. This is a much more efficient craft compared to the vanilla craft.

**Gear and Loot:**
- Suspicious sand can now generate on the desert biome's surface. Upon brushing, it can reveal either junk or rarely treasure such as diamonds or emeralds
- Large patches of suspicious sand can now generate on the desert biome's surface that when brushed reveal bones. These patches reveal that somewhere under them lies a fossil.
- Suspicious sand and gravel can now generate in rivers which can reveal gold upon being brushed
- The mending enchantment has been changed. Upon picking up an experience orb, gear with mending will no longer automatically repair itself. Rather, it will reduce its repair cost at an anvil.
- Elder Guardians now have a 1/3 chance of dropping a Mending Book
- Netherite gear can now be repaired at an anvil with diamonds
- Elytras can be fully repaired with 1 Dragon Scale
- Tridents can be repaired using Prismarine Crystals at a reduced rate
- A Turtle Helmet can now be upgraded as a netherite upgrade into a Strider Helmet. The Strider Helmet grants 20 seconds of extra water breathing and 5 seconds of extra fire resistance.
- The Fletching Table now has a GUI that can be accessed by right clicking it. Placing an arrow on the left slot and an ingredient on the right slot lets you tip the arrow.
- Placing a potion as a fletching ingredient tips the arrow with that potion making it far easier to craft tipped arrows
- Placing an Amethyst Shard as a fletching ingredient makes the arrow shatter into 3 small shards when hitting an enemy. These shards deal the same damage as the original arrow. 
- Placing TNT as a fletching ingredient make the arrow explode when hitting an enemy
- Placing a Red Mushroom as a fletching ingredient makes the arrow inflict blindness, slowness and nausea for 8 seconds
- Placing an Echo Shard as a fletching ingredient makes the arrow travel twice as fast
- Placing a Glowstone Block as a fletching ingredient gives spectral arrows

**Mobs:**
- Mobs now have a 25% chance to critically strike a player in a random part of their body. If the player does not have armor in that part, they will take 1.5x the damage
- If the player does have armor to protect from the critical strike, the armor will take extra damage to its durability
- After a player has made netherite gear for the first time, buffed piglins will begin to naturally spawn in the overworld around them
- Phantoms will no longer naturally drop phantom membranes
- After a player enters the end, phantoms that naturally spawn around them will be slightly bigger and can drop phantom membranes (to repair elytra with)
- After a player enters the end, the naturally spawning piglins around them will always spawn with a piece of netherite armor (that can't be dropped)
- The Ender Dragon now takes 80% less damage from block explosions
- Once reaching 0 health, the Ender Dragon will reach its second phase, creating a massive lightning storm and healing to full. 
- The Ender Dragon gains three new 'attacks' during its second phase that it can use periodically:
  - It will channel lightning on itself and strike the tallest block at each player, dealing heavy damage if it does manage to hit the player
  - It can summon a fireball that moves rapidly towards the player and explodes (Similar to Ghast but with heavier damage)
  - It can cloak every player in darkness and call on a few Endermen to start targeting each player
- The Ender Dragon can drop 2-4 dragon scales on death

**Fishing:**
- Almost completely reworked the fishing system
- There are now different types of fishing rods: Default, Copper, Platinum and Resonant. Each one having a faster catch time than the previous
- Copper fishing rod is crafted using 3 Copper Blocks and 2 String in the same way as a regular fishing rod and can use bait
- Platinum fishing rod is crafting using 3 Platinum Ingots and 2 String in the same way as a regular fishing rod and can use bait
- Resonant fishing rod is crafting using 3 Resonant Ingots and 2 String in the same way as a regular fishing rod and can use bait AND tackle
- 1 Resonant Ingot can be crafted using 2 Platinum Ingots and 2 Echo Shards
- Regular bait can be obtained by smelting rotten flesh in a furnace. Using it will half the time it takes to catch a fish.
- Magnet bait can be obtain my surrounding a copper ingot with iron nuggets and it increases the chance to catch treasure
- Premium bait can be crafted with 1 golden carrot and 1 baked potato. Using it will reduce the time it takes to catch a fish by 75%.
- There are 4 types of tackle that can be obtained from Desert Temples, Shipwrecks, Mineshaft chests and Fisherman Villagers 
- Rain increases the rate at which fish can be caught
- Different types of fish can now be caught depending on the season, time of day and biome
- Rarer fish are typically heavier and must be caught through a minigame where you keep the fish inside the green area
- 3 Fish can be placed in a cauldron with fire/campfire under it to create Fish Stew which grants potion effects/benefits depending on the fish used and their weights
- Treasure Sand can be caught when fishing which can be brushed containing revamped treasure
- Treasure Chests can also be caught when fishing which contains 3 pieces of treasure
- Wandering Trader can now sell Fish Codex which displays all fish that exist and how many they have caught alongside other information

**Horses:**
- Maximum horse stats increased, especially speed (Up to 21.5 blocks/s)
- Horse breeding and stats now work on a completely new system. Every naturally spawned horse has two randomly chosen alleles for each gene (health, speed and jumpheight). Its actual speed/health/jump height is the average value between its two alleles.
- When two horses breed, the foul inherits two of the four alleles from its parents with a slight chance of positive or negative mutation.
- Added Saddle 'n' Horseshoe which halves the fall damage a horse takes when worn. Can be crafted by combining a saddle and 2 iron blocks at a smithing table.

**Seasons:**
- Added Seasons to the game. Every world starts in Spring, with each season lasting 30 in game days.
- Crops grow the fastest in Spring, and the slowest in Winter
- Grass and Foliage colour changes in the autumn (Upon reconnect)
- Weather now starts at the start of the day and lasts until the next morning.
- Rain and Storms are more common in the Summer but can't occur during Winter
- There is a small chance for a Tempest to occur during the Summer where lightning storms can happen throughout the day and night
- Snowy days and Blizzards can happen in Winter in which snow starts to fall in biomes where it usually doesn't
- Blizzards allow snow to pile up substantially and become powder snow
- Blizzards cause players out in the open to freeze and take damage. This effect is reduced by wearing leather armor.
- This snow will gradually melt in Spring and Summer
- Windy days can occur in the Spring and Autumn where petals/leaves fall from the sky (Purely visual)
- A Weather Radio can be bought from an Expert Cartographer Villager which will display the Date, Season and tomorrow's weather forecast
- A Weather Beacon can be made using a Nether Star, 4 Dragon Scales and 4 Redstone Blocks which can clear the weather on right click
- The Winter Solstice will happen in the middle of winter where the night will be longer but special glow squids will surface the ocean
- These glow squids drop different colored ink sacs which can be used in an anvil when renaming items to change the item name's color

**Miscellaneous:**
- When a lightning rod above a copper block is struck by lightning, the energy will pass through up to 32 copper blocks in any direction. It will not pass through weathered copper but it can pass through waxed copper blocks
- Any furnaces, blast furnaces or smokers adjacent to an energized copper block will be powered for 60 seconds and will smelt items 2x as fast as usual for the duration
- Up to 9 furnaces/blast furnaces/smokers can be powered by a single lightning strike
